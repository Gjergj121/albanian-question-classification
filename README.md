This repository contains the training and evaluation code of deep learning models and the baseline models for the Question Classification task in the Albanian language.
-  The baseline models include Support Vector Machine, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression.
-  Deep Learning models include BiLSTM, Transformer, and RoBERTa.
The dataset is created by translating in the Albanian language the English version of the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) dataset, and then curated manually.
